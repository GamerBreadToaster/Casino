Open main.py to begin the program.
I made this to have a bit of fun and to learn python more.
Please don't shit too much on my program, i am a beginner to programming an python.

When you first open the program it will make an txt file named SafeFile.txt and is the safe file for the game/casino.
Everytime you can enter something (exept in games and the bets menu) the safe file gets updated with your stats.
Everytime you exit the program via the intended way it will make an txt file named 'time played.txt' and is purely functional.
When you lose all your money and you gameover the program will make an txt file named 'Game stats.txt' with your stats on how you did.
I recommend to unzip the Casino.zip in a folder so you don't have an mess.

To play the casino I made it as easy as possible to understand whats going on.
If your asked to input an number, you need to look at what the numbers mean.
For example, at the beginning your asked to choose what you want to do:

0: exit programm
1: minigames
2: slots
choose here: 

if you enter 1, you will go to the minigames secion.
and if you enter 2, you will go to the slots secion.
it is like this for the whole program.

You are free to use my code however you like but atleast credit me if you do.
