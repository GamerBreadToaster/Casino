Open main.py to begin the program.
I made this to have a bit of fun and to learn python more.
Please don't shit too much on my program, i am a beginner to programming an python.

To play the casino I made it as easy as possible to understand whats going on.
If your asked to input an number, you need to look at at the numbers mean.
For example, at the beginning your asked to choose what you want to do:

0: exit programm
1: minigames
2: slots
choose here: 

if you enter 1, you will go to the minigames secion.
and if you enter 2, you will go to the slots secion.
it is like this for the whole program.

You are free to use my code however you like but atleast credit me if you do.

If you have any tips, please notify me on https://github.com/GamerBreadToaster/Casino/.
